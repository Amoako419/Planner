# Event-Planning-Application

## Project Description
>About the project-
This is an application that will be your one-stop for all your gifting, idea collection, event planning, and preparation solutions. Not only will one be able to schedule gifts well ahead of time but one will also collect options and ideas for the same. No more creating mood boards, notes, and carts across different applications and being ill-prepared or forgetting important events. In this rush world, it’ll save your time as well as ease the process of planning. Your events will be read from your google calendar as well as you could add them. The application will collect your choices just by sharing them with this app which could be collected specifically for an event, or group of events, or saved for later. On the app’s home page you would be able to view your calendar, scroll through your choices, and plan upcoming events. On the account’s page, you would be able to maintain your account and also get your history for example past purchases so that you could refer to or use them again. When you get the notification reminding you about the event well ahead of time you could able to snooze it, view details, and go ahead to execute your plans.
